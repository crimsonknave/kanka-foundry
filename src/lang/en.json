One change is, that journal entries imported from kanka are no longer editable. That was never truly supported anyways, as changes were overwritten with the next import and could not be synced back to Kanka.</p><p>If you have changed any of the imported journal entries by hand:</p><p><big style=\"color: red;\"><strong>Backup your data now! Upgrading will overwrite all imported journal entries!</strong></big></p><p>Please refer to the modules <a href=\"https://github.com/eXaminator/kanka-foundry\" target=\"_blank\">Github repository</a> to see all changes of the new version. If you want to keep the old version, you'll have to skip the migration now, manually downgrade to an older release (all available at github) and lock the module version in the package manager screen (a new feature of Foundry 0.8.x).</p><p> Do you want to upgrade your existing journal entries to the new version? <strong>This will start a reimport from Kanka for all imported journal entries and overwrite the versions you currently have synced.</strong> This might take a few minutes, depending on the size of your Kanka campaign and the amount of synced entries. You will receive a notification once it's done.</p><h2>But I already ran this migration!</h2><p> You might have synced entries from multiple campaigns. This migration only updates entries from the currently selected campaign ({campaignName}). If you keep getting this message, change the selected campaign in the modules settings and reload your browser to try again.</p><p>Should you keep running into trouble, please let me know by creating an issue in Github.</p>",
